# Midnight Plaza Modpacks
This is a collection of modpacks used within Midnight Plaza for various different games, including Lethal Company, Content Warning, and more. 

### Lethal Company
- This includes two modpacks, one which contains core mods for enhancing gameplay, the other is for additional cosmetics wanted by friends.

__Core Modpack__
**Main Additions**
- The core modpack contains 16 new planets and moons, including Orion, Aquatis, and Celest by sfDesat, and Infernis, Acidir, Etern, Atlantica, Polarus, Gratar, Asteriod 13, Cosmocos, Junic, Gloom, Desolation, Fission, and Oldred by Wesley. 
- There are also _at least_ two new interiors including The Toy Store and The Grand Armory by Wesley.

**Multiplayer Changes**
- There is now support for up to 32 players (capped at 16 for performance, however, this can be changed in the Lethal Config menu).
- Added tonnes of new emotes and suits to express yourself further.
- Helmet cameras in the ship now dispaly at 1024x1024 resolution (from the previous 48x48 in vanilla).
- Collecting loot and brining it back to the ship grants experience which can be used to increase character stats, including but not limited to health regeneration, more stamina, increased battery life, slots and loot value.
- For 500 Credits, you can revive a fellow player who has died through the Late Game Upgrades mod, however, this will spawn them in at a random location.

**Gameplay Changes**
- The game will now support 21:9 and 32:9 aspect ratios, and the default FOV has been increased to 90 (from 66), and 110 while interacting with the terminal (to better accomodate 21:9 and 32:9 aspect ratios).
- There are now 5 item slots in the beginning, in addition to 2 reserved slots for Flashlights (`F` to Toggle On/Off), and Spray Paint.
- There is now an on-screen minimap (for balancing, loot and enemies are hidden by default, however, this can be enabled in the mod options through `F1` — note that for each instance, you will have to manually override the ship controls through the `Select Target` menu in the mod's settings page in `F1`).
- More severe weather will increase the value of loot found to correspond with the added difficulty of weather events — Rainy 1.1x, Foggy 1.2x, Stormy 1.25x, Flooded 1.5x, Eclipsed 2x.
- Texture resolutions have been changed so that they are higher quality — this can be disabled if you would like to maintain the rough feeling of vanilla. 
- The ship now has windows which allow you to see outside, and will change based on planets, moons and will allow you to see outside when landing (by default, these windows will not anger enemies, however, this can also be configured in Lethal Config — these windows are also unlocked by default at the beginning).

### Content Warning
- This modpack contains various mods and custom configurations with the aim of enhancing the gameplay of Content Warning. These changes include footage which you can find recorded by other players, quality of life changes to gameplay such as more colours (which are applied to your suit), unrestricted character limits, inventory slots, changes to the shop, as well as improvments to oxygen and the diving bell.
