# Kikii's v60 Core Mods
The following modpack consists of mods which enhance your gameplay experience in Lethal Company, with hand picked mods popular amongst my friends — there is also an add-on pack which adds further cosmetic changes such as reskins and changes to sounds. 

## Major Additions
- 16 New Moons & Planets including Orion, Aquatis, and Celest by sfDesat, and Infernis, Acidir, Etern, Atlantica, Polarus, Gratar, Asteriod 13, Cosmocos, Junic, Gloom, Desolation, Fission, and Oldred by Wesley. 
- *At least* 2 new interiors including The Toy Store, and The Grand Armory by Wesley.

## Multiplayer Changes

- Lots of emotes and suits to express yourself :3
- The helmet cameras now display in 1024x1024 (from 48x48).
- Experience will be gained from collecting loot which can be used to increase your characters stats, including health regeneration, more stamina, increased battery life, slots, and loot value. 
- For 500 Credits, you can revive a person who has died, however, this will spawn them in at a random location.
