# Kikii's v60 Core (COSMETICS ADD-ON)
The following mod simply adds cosmetic changes as requested, including the following.
- The Loot Bug "chittering" sound is now "Yippee", as requested by Samuel (Jammies) and Gabe (Scapegoat)
- The Bracken is now Freddy Fazbear from the Five Nights at Freddy's Franchise, with changes to sounds to fit this change too, as requested by Gabe (Scapegoat)
- There is an addition of a thicker intern model as requested by Patrick â€” however, this is partially incompatible with the emote mods selected in ([Kikii's v60 Core Mod Pack](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/KrsnaCallisto/Kikiis_Core_v60/)).
